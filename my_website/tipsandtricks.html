        1. Check Your Code Often: The best way not to make mistakes when coding 
        is to constantly check your code and to test it after each revision or addition.<br><br>
        2. Write Down Ideas: It is a good habit to write down any thoughts or ideas 
        for things that you may want to add to your wbsite so that you do not forget them later. <br><br>
        3. Research: There are many things that you can do to code HTML, and you are not going to remember 
        it all. So, find a trustworthy source that you can use to look up any answers to questions that you may have.<br><br>
        4. Make Mistakes: The best way to learn anything is to mess up and learn from it. Do your best to trouble-shoot 
        on your own before using help from peers or resources, that way, you make your own connections and discoveries.
