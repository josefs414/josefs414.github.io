	  <h1><br> About Me: <br></h1>
	 <p>I am currently a shophmore, and will graduate from CHS with the class of 2021.<br><br>
	       I am on the Coronado waterpolo team and play on both the Novice and JV teams. I am working hard to become a Varsity player next year.<br><br>
	       I am enterested in becoming a pilot for the US NAVY, and would like to go to school at the Navel Academy.<br><br>
	       I also have a deep interest in the universe outside of our planet, and enjoy watching the science channel.<br><br>
	       If I were to have a second job, I would become an engineer because I am inspired by those who work hard to make the lives of other people better.<br><br>
	       My goal in life is to make friends with everyone that I meet, and to enjoy life as it is (and try to make it better).
